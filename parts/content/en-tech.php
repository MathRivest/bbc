                <p>All instruments that have been used are placed in a decontamination container, which is then placed in a sterilization apparatus at 93°C for one hour. Following this first step of sterilization, the instruments are then wrapped and placed in another sterilization device for an additional hour at 132°C, and then placed in a dryer before being used again. Anything that cannot be sterilized or discarded is disinfected and covered with plastic wrap, and changed after each visit. Chairs and counters are cleaned and disinfected between each appointment. In addition, the water pipes that supply our dental appliances are routinely treated with an antibacterial cleanser.</p>
                <p>These hygiene standards are checked and updated regularly for your safety and peace of mind.</p>
