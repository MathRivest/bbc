                            <p>Dental fillings are used to repair damage created by decay and to prevent the tooth from further deterioration. This procedure involves inserting a material into the damaged dental cavity. Several materials are available: an amalgam, a composite, a CEREC ceramic or a silver filling (this material is no longer used in our clinic due to the toxicity of mercury). The most importance factors in treating cavities are choosing the appropriate material and determining the best treatment.

                            <p>The term "periodontal disease" includes all diseases affecting the tissues supporting the teeth. Gingivitis, for example, will present as bleeding of the gums during brushing, gum swelling and/or pain and persistent bad breath. Gum inflammation should be treated quickly to avoid the possibility of periodontal disease as tissues supporting the teeth will be affected. Periodontal disease is the main cause of adult tooth loss and can lead to other health problems if left untreated (cardiovascular diseases and premature births). With proper periodontal treatment, the health of the gums can be restored.</p>

                            <p>It is important to keep one’s own teeth as long as possible. Root canal therapy is a wise choice to save a tooth that would otherwise require extraction. Here are some examples where root canal treatment is required: in the case of deep cavities that reach the pulp (the living portion of the tooth), a dental infection or severe pain. Root canal treatment involves removing the inflamed pulp or infected tooth, followed by cleaning and disinfecting the inner portion of the tooth known as the canal.</p>

                            <p>There are two types of gingival grafts (gum grafts). Autogenous grafts involve transplanting tissue from the palate to the affected site. Allogenic transplantation involves covering the chosen site with a collagen membrane. A gingival graft is usually recommended to treat gum recession, which occurs when the height of the gum decreases and the root of the tooth becomes exposed.</p>

                            <p>Orthodontic treatment is done for various reasons: to straighten crooked or misaligned teeth, to correct malocclusions, or to improve the appearance of your smile. There are conventional treatments, such as metallic or transparent braces, or the innovative Invisalign technology, which straightens the teeth without visible braces, clips or wires. Invisalign uses three-dimensional computer technology to sketch-out the entire treatment process from beginning to end. Using this plan, a series of custom-made, transparent and removable retainers (aligners) are manufactured. Each retainer in the series is worn for approximately two weeks up until the teeth gradually move to their final position.</p>

When a tooth has been lost, the height and width of the bone base diminish. Therefore, it is possible that a graft will be necessary to help support the implant.</p>
